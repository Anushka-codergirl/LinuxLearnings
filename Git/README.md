# Installing Git with Default Packages

Git is likely already installed. We can confirm this by running the following command:

```bash
    anushcodergirl@host:~$ git --version
```
If we receive output similar to the following, then Git is already installed.

Output: 

```bash
    git version 2.25.1
```

However, if we didn't get output of a Git version number, we can install it with the Ubuntu default package manager APT.

By typing this command in our terminal
```bash
    sudo apt install git
```
